This project demonstrates how to stream a video over the web using HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) with multiple resolutions and manual quality selection via hls.js.

Step 1: Prepare the Source Video
I began by downloading a sample video file and saving it locally on my device.

To prepare it for streaming, I installed FFmpeg via Homebrew:

    brew install ffmpeg
